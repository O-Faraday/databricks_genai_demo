## üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Unity Catalog Functions (Tools)

Based on the tables, here are the recommended UC functions to implement:

### 1. **check_order_status(order_id)**
```sql
-- Returns: order status, tracking_number, estimated_delivery
-- Joins orders table with order_items for complete order details
```

### 2. **check_product_stock(product_id)**
```sql
-- Returns: stock_quantity, warehouse_location, availability status
-- Alerts if stock is low (< 10 units)
```

### 3. **calculate_shipping(customer_id, total_weight_kg, destination_country, destination_region)**
```sql
-- Returns: shipping cost, estimated delivery days, available options
-- Considers customer tier (Gold gets free express shipping)
-- Looks up shipping_zones table for rates
```

### 4. **get_customer_orders(customer_id)**
```sql
-- Returns: order history with status, dates, totals
-- Joins orders with order_items and products for full details
```

### 5. **check_return_eligibility(order_id)**
```sql
-- Returns: eligible (yes/no), reason, days_remaining
-- Checks order_date against current date
-- Considers product category and order status
-- Returns number of days left in return window
```

### 6. **get_product_details(product_id)**
```sql
-- Returns: full product information including price, specs, stock
-- Used for product recommendations and comparisons
```

### 7. **get_customer_tier_benefits(customer_id)**

## üí° Example Agent Queries

Here are realistic queries that combine retriever (PDFs) + tools (functions):

### 1. **Order Status Check**
**Query:** "Where is my order 1003?"

**Expected Flow:**
- Tool: `check_order_status(1003)` ‚Üí Status: shipped, Tracking: TRK1234567892
- Retriever: Search shipping_guide.pdf for tracking instructions
- **Answer:** Your order is shipped! Tracking number TRK1234567892. Estimated delivery: 3-5 business days. You can track it at [carrier link].

### 2. **Product Availability + Compatibility**
**Query:** "Do you have the UltraView 4K monitor in stock? Will it work with my MacBook Pro?"

**Expected Flow:**
- Tool: `check_product_stock(1)` ‚Üí 45 units in stock
- Retriever: Search product_catalog.pdf for UltraView specs and compatibility
- **Answer:** Yes, in stock (45 units available). The UltraView 4K Monitor is fully compatible with MacBook Pro. Connect via USB-C (DisplayPort Alt Mode) or HDMI 2.0. Supports macOS 10.13+. Native 4K resolution works perfectly with Mac's scaling.

### 3. **Shipping Cost Calculation**
**Query:** "How much will shipping cost for the Gaming Chair to California?"

**Expected Flow:**
- Tool: `get_product_details(9)` ‚Üí Weight: 22 kg
- Tool: `calculate_shipping(customer_id, 22, 'USA', 'West Coast')` ‚Üí Base $8.99 + (22 √ó $2.25) = $58.49
- Retriever: Search shipping_guide.pdf for large item shipping policies
- **Answer:** The Gaming Chair weighs 22 kg. Standard shipping to California: $58.49 (5-7 business days). Due to size/weight, freight shipping is required. Delivery to curb/threshold. White glove delivery (inside home + assembly) available for additional $79.99.

### 4. **Return Policy Question**
**Query:** "Can I return my opened wireless headphones?"

**Expected Flow:**
- Retriever: Search return_policy.pdf for return conditions and non-returnable items
- **Answer:** Yes, audio equipment like headphones can be returned within 30 days if unused or lightly used, with all original accessories and packaging. However, in-ear headphones cannot be returned once opened for hygiene reasons. Over-ear headphones like the Noise-Canceling Headphones are returnable. The item must be in original condition with no signs of wear.

### 5. **Complex Support Query with Troubleshooting**
**Query:** "My laptop won't turn on after it arrived yesterday. What should I do?"

**Expected Flow:**
- Tool: `check_order_status(order_id)` ‚Üí Delivered yesterday
- Retriever: Search technical_faq.pdf for laptop won't turn on troubleshooting
- Retriever: Search return_policy.pdf for DOA (Dead on Arrival) policy
- **Answer:** I'm sorry your new laptop isn't working! Let's try these steps: (1) Connect charger and verify LED lights up, (2) Hold power button for 30 seconds, reconnect charger, try again, (3) If still no response, this qualifies as Dead on Arrival (DOA). Since you received it yesterday, we'll immediately send a replacement at no cost, including return shipping. We'll also refund your original shipping charges. Would you like me to initiate the DOA replacement now?

### 6. **Product Recommendation with Customer Context**
**Query:** "I need a good keyboard for programming under $150"

**Expected Flow:**
- Tool: `get_customer_tier_benefits(customer_id)` ‚Üí Gold tier, free express shipping
- Tool: Filter products by category='Accessories', price<150, name contains 'keyboard'
- Retriever: Search product_catalog.pdf for keyboard details
- **Answer:** I recommend the Mechanical Keyboard RGB ($129.99). Perfect for programming with hot-swappable mechanical switches (Red linear, tactile feedback), N-key rollover, programmable macros, and durable construction. As a Gold member, you get free express shipping (2-3 days). Plus it's in stock at Warehouse B!

### 7. **Multi-step Order Issue**
**Query:** "I ordered a monitor but received a mouse. I need the monitor by Friday."

**Expected Flow:**
- Tool: `check_order_status(order_id)` ‚Üí Identify wrong item shipped
- Retriever: Search return_policy.pdf for "wrong item shipped" section
- Tool: `check_product_stock(product_id)` ‚Üí Verify monitor still in stock
- Tool: `calculate_shipping` with express option ‚Üí Calculate fastest delivery
- **Answer:** I apologize for the error! Here's what we'll do immediately: (1) I'm sending the correct UltraView 4K Monitor via express overnight shipping at no charge - it will arrive by Thursday. (2) Keep the incorrect mouse until the monitor arrives, then use the prepaid return label we'll email you. (3) No charges for return shipping, and we're applying a $25 credit to your account for the inconvenience. Your new tracking number will arrive in 1 hour.

## üöÄ Implementation Tips for Databricks

### Vector Store Setup
```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from databricks.vector_search.client import VectorSearchClient

# Chunk the PDFs for optimal retrieval
splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000,
    chunk_overlap=200,
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", ". ", " ", ""]
)

# Process each PDF
documents = []
for pdf_file in ['product_catalog.pdf', 'return_policy.pdf', 'shipping_guide.pdf', 'technical_faq.pdf']:
    chunks = splitter.split_documents([pdf_file])
    for chunk in chunks:
        chunk.metadata['source'] = pdf_file
        chunk.metadata['category'] = pdf_file.split('.')[0]
    documents.extend(chunks)

# Create Databricks Vector Search index
vsc = VectorSearchClient()
index = vsc.create_direct_access_index(
    endpoint_name="ecommerce_endpoint",
    index_name="ecommerce_knowledge_base",
    primary_key="id",
    embedding_dimension=1536,  # Adjust based on embedding model
    embedding_vector_column="embedding",
    schema={"id": "string", "text": "string", "embedding": "array<float>", "metadata": "string"}
)
```
